# Ivan Nikitin's gemini page

I am a PhD student at the University of Glasgow under the supervision of Dr Colin Perkins and Dr Ornela Dardha. 
I work on using formal methods to improve network protocol specifications and the network protocol standardisation process. 
Before this, I completed my undergraduate at UofG in June 2022, with my final year dissertation analysing QUIC as a transport layer for IoT devices, specifically as the transport layer for the MQTT protocol.
